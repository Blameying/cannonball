# Cannonball ðŸ’£

Cannonball is a framework for building QEMU plugins in Rust! Anything you can do in
a QEMU TCG plugin in C, you can do with `cannonball`.

Write plugins that run with minimal overhead and as much functionality as you can dream
of!

## Examples

There are a couple examples provided here!

* [`jaivana`](examples/jaivana/README.md) A simple tracer that logs a configurable set of events to a file or stdout.
* [`mons meg`](examples/mons_meg/README.md) A tracer that logs the same events as Jaivana, but uses Tokio to run the trace in an async environment, with communication
  with the host over a UNIX socket instead of anonymous pipes.

## Documentation

Unfortunately, the documentation isn't building on `docs.rs`. Something about building
the entirety of QEMU is busting their process limits a little! For now, you can build
and view local docs with:

```
cargo doc --open
```

Or, the source code is all doc-stringed up :)

## Installation

Just add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
cannonball = "0.2.3"
```

## Example

Here's a quick recording of the [Jaivana](./examples/jaivana) example plugin and driver!
